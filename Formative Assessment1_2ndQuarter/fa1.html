	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>When my workday starts, I wake up and get out of bed, feeling ready to face the day. I eat a healthy breakfast to give me energy and take some time to get myself ready. I choose formal work clothes that are professional but still comfortable enough to wear all day. After getting dressed, I gather all the things I will need for the day, such as my laptop, documents, and any personal items. Then, I leave my home and head to the audit firm building. Once I arrive, I meet with my team, greet everyone, and settle at my desk. We start our work on our laptops, reviewing financial documents, preparing reports, and collaborating on different tasks to make sure everything is accurate and organized.</p>

	      <p>As the owner of the firm, my main job is to examine financial statements and accounting records to make sure everything is correct and follows accounting standards. I spend a lot of time reviewing reports and checking if all the numbers add up properly. I also hold meetings with my clients, who are mostly business owners, to talk about their finances, risks, and ways they can improve or grow their companies. Together, we plan strategies to help them manage their money better. Besides working with clients, I also manage the daily operations of my firm and supervise my staff to make sure everyone is doing their work correctly and efficiently. Being in charge means I have to balance both leadership and accuracy to keep my business successful (What Is a CPA and How Do I Become One?, n.d.).</p>

	      <p>In this video, it summarizes the role of auditors who are also CPAs. They studied accountancy but chose to specialize in auditing. They investigate financial records and meet with clients to assess internal business operations. They explain their findings to the clients and offer suggestions to strengthen their financial systems. They use accounting software, audit checklists, and spreadsheets to perform their work, which is to identify inconsistencies in numbers and calculations.</p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>A short inspiring story I can share is about my dadâ€™s experience as a CPA accountant. After he passed the CPA board exam, he started working in a small company in the finance department. Later, he was promoted to manager. Then, he got an opportunity to work at a bigger company with triple the pay, which was also when he met my mom. A few years later, he was given a chance to work at an even bigger company with an even higher salary. His work mainly involves procurement and warehousing, which means he helps the company buy the right products and services, manages orders, and makes sure everything is delivered on time. He also oversees inventory in the warehouse, making sure items are stored properly and used efficiently. This story inspires me to work hard and try to achieve more in life. My father always tells me to never settle for less and to always aim for something bigger.</p>
